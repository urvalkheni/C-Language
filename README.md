# C Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to my C programming repository! This repository contains a collection of programs and projects that I have written as part of my coursework during my time in college. Each program is designed to solve specific problems or demonstrate key programming concepts in C.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on topics or assignments. Here's how the structure might look:

```
📁 Basic Programs
    📄 hello_world.c
    📄 arithmetic_operations.c
📁 Control Structures
    📄 if_else_example.c
    📄 switch_case_example.c
📁 Data Structures
    📄 linked_list.c
    📄 stack_implementation.c
📁 Algorithms
    📄 bubble_sort.c
    📄 binary_search.c
```

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Beginner to Advanced:** Programs range from basic syntax and control structures to advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
- **Educational Purpose:** Each program is well-documented with comments to make it easier to understand the code logic.

   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and compile the C program using a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
