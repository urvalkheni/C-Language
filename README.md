# C Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to my C programming repository! This repository contains a collection of programs and projects that I have written as part of my coursework during my time in college. Each program is designed to solve specific problems or demonstrate key programming concepts in C.

## üîë Key Features

- **Beginner to Advanced:** Programs range from basic syntax and control structures to advanced topics like data structures and algorithms.
- **Educational Purpose:** Each program is well-documented with comments to make it easier to understand the code logic.
- **Reusable Code:** Feel free to reuse and adapt the code for your own learning or projects.

## üíª How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/urvalkheni/C-Language/Code.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and compile the C program using a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
